# SevenAppsCaseStudy

This is a two-page application that lists users retrieved from the JSONPlaceholder API. When a user is clicked, the app navigates to the user details page.

Protocol-oriented programming has been used to apply unit testing and SOLID principles. Service layers have been created to separate data operations from the business layer. Since the focus is on coding structure, the UI design has been kept simple. Additionally, the app supports both English and Turkish languages.
